- -----ABOUT ME-----
- From the day I was born, we had a family computer - what now is an obsolete Packard Bell running Windows XP. I vividly remember the colourful GUI and the start-up chime that I would run towards when I heard it. As a young boy, I watched as my father typed into the computer that I'd be seated on his lap to see what else a computer has to offer. My interest materialised by watching my father do mundane tasks, from surfing the web or completing a document; for me, this was enough for my imagination to run wild.
