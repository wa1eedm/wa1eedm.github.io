        <h1>Exploring the Gemini Protocol</h1>

        <p>
            As a computer science student about to graduate, I’ve been experimenting with different technologies to build my online presence. One that caught my eye is the Gemini protocol, a lightweight alternative to HTTP for hosting websites. I decided to try hosting a personal site with Gemini, and this page shares what it is, why I chose it, how it went, what I liked, and the advantages and disadvantages I found.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Gemini Protocol?</h2>

        <p>
            Gemini is a simple internet protocol launched in 2019, designed to be a middle ground between the complex modern web and the bare-bones Gopher protocol from the 1990s. Unlike HTTP, which powers most websites with dynamic features like videos and scripts, Gemini focuses on delivering plain text with basic formatting, such as headings and links. It uses strong encryption to keep connections secure and prioritises privacy by avoiding trackers, cookies, or client-side scripts. It’s meant for small, content-focused sites, like personal blogs or portfolios, making it an interesting choice for someone like me who wants a minimalist online space.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Chose Gemini</h2>

        <p>
            I came across Gemini while researching ways to host a personal site without the complexity of modern web development. As a computer science graduate, I’m curious about alternative technologies that challenge the status quo of HTTP’s bloated ecosystem. Gemini appealed to me because it promised simplicity, letting me focus on content rather than wrestling with JavaScript or CSS frameworks. I also liked its emphasis on privacy, as it avoids the tracking common on HTTP sites. Hosting a Gemini site felt like a fun experiment to test my technical skills, from setting up a server to learning a new protocol, while creating a space to share my projects and ideas.
        </p>

        <h2>Hosting a Personal Site with Gemini</h2>

        <p>
            Setting up my Gemini site was surprisingly straightforward, which was a relief given my busy final year at university. I used a simple Gemini server software, like Jetforce, which runs on Python and is easy to install on my Linux laptop. I created a few text files in Gemini’s markup language, called Gemtext, which is much simpler than HTML. For example, I wrote a homepage with links to my projects and an about page, using basic headings and paragraphs. I hosted the site on my local machine for testing, then deployed it to a small virtual server I rented for a few pounds a month. The whole process took a couple of hours, and I was thrilled to access my site using a Gemini browser, like Lagrange, which showed my text neatly formatted and free of clutter. The experience felt like stepping back to the early internet, but with modern security.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Liked</h2>

        <p>
            My favourite part of using Gemini was its sheer simplicity. Writing content in Gemtext was a breeze, as it’s just plain text with a few symbols for formatting, so I could focus on what I wanted to say rather than how it looked. The security was another highlight, as Gemini uses encryption by default, meaning my site’s connections were safe without extra setup. I also enjoyed the small, enthusiastic community around Gemini, where developers share tips and tools on forums and mailing lists. As a computer science student, I found it refreshing to work with a protocol that’s easy to understand and tinker with, unlike HTTP’s endless layers of complexity. Hosting my site felt personal and authentic, like a digital notebook rather than a flashy webpage.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of Gemini</h2>

        <p>
            Gemini has several advantages that make it appealing for personal sites. It’s incredibly fast because it only serves lightweight text files, so my site loaded instantly even on a basic server. The strong encryption ensures privacy, as there’s no room for trackers or ads, which is great for users who value security. Setting up a Gemini site is simple, requiring minimal coding knowledge, which suited me as I juggled coursework and projects. It’s also resource-efficient, using far less server power than an HTTP site, which kept my hosting costs low. The lack of client-side scripts, like JavaScript, reduces security risks, as there’s no chance of malicious code running in a visitor’s browser. For a minimalist like me, Gemini’s focus on content over style was a perfect fit, letting me share my work without distractions.
        </p>

        <h2>Disadvantages of Gemini</h2>

        <p>
            Despite its strengths, Gemini has limitations that I noticed while hosting my site. Its biggest drawback is limited adoption, as very few people use Gemini browsers, so my site reached a tiny audience compared to an HTTP site. This makes it less practical for sharing with a wide network, like recruiters or classmates. Gemini’s simplicity also means it lacks dynamic features, such as forms, interactive apps, or embedded media, which restricted me to plain text and links. For example, I couldn’t add a contact form or display project screenshots directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compatibility is another issue, as Gemini requires a special browser or client, and most people stick to Chrome or Firefox for HTTP sites. As a computer science graduate, I enjoyed the technical challenge, but I found Gemini’s niche status and lack of advanced functionality limiting for a portfolio meant to showcase my full skill set. There’s also the risk that the protocol’s small community might not sustain it long-term, which could make my site obsolete.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            Hosting a personal site with the Gemini protocol was a rewarding experiment that taught me a lot as a computer science graduate. I loved its simplicity, speed, and privacy focus, which made creating and sharing content feel pure and straightforward. Setting up the site was a fun way to apply my technical skills, from configuring a server to writing Gemtext, and the community’s enthusiasm was infectious. While Gemini’s advantages, like low resource use and strong security, are impressive, its limited audience and lack of dynamic features mean it’s not a full replacement for HTTP, especially for a job-seeking student like me. Still, the experience deepened my understanding of internet protocols and reinforced my love for minimalist technology. I’d recommend Gemini to anyone curious about alternative web solutions, and I’m excited to keep exploring how it can complement my HTTP site as I launch my career in tech.
